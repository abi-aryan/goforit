I am a Machine Learning (ML) Engineer and a Data Science Fellow at Insight in Toronto. I was previously a Visiting Research Scholar at UCLA under Dr. Judea Pearl where I worked in AutoML, MultiAgent Systems and Emotion Recognition. Prior to that, I worked as product and engineering head for five years with startups across U.S., U.K., and India. I attended London School of Economics (LSE) for a Masters in Applicable Mathematics and did my Bachelors in Mathematics with minors in Statistics and Computer Science from Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU) . I am, foremost, driven by the goal to create personalized humane-agents that can influence and alter human decision making, but subsconsciously, also the nagging desire to leave the world a slightly better place than I found it. A tad bit geeky and a gadget lover at heart, I am equally fascinated by large-scale engineering application design as well as low level computer hardware engineering including microprocessors, crafting compilers, integrated chip design etc. I am also passionate about communities and helping self-taught engineers get into technical careers. I am the Director for Women Who Code Los Angeles and founded MLNerdie to bridge the gap between academia and industry in machine learning with chapters and volunteers spread across three continents .

Read on to learn how sponsorship works , and how easy it is to get access to Insiders . A demo is worth a thousand words \u2014 check it out at squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material-insiders How sponsorship works \u00b6 New features first land in Insiders, which means that sponsors will have access immediately . Every feature is tied to a funding goal in monthly subscriptions. When a funding goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back into Material for MkDocs and released for general availability. Bugfixes are always released simultaneously in both editions. 1 Don't want to sponsor? No problem, Material for MkDocs already has tons of features available, so chances are that most of your requirements are already satisfied. See the list of exclusive features to learn which features are currently only available to sponsors. How to become a sponsor \u00b6 You can become a sponsor using your individual or organization's GitHub account. Just visit squidfunk's sponsor profile , pick any tier from $10/month , and complete the checkout. Then, after a few hours, @squidfunk will add you as a collaborator to the super-secret private GitHub repositority containing the Insiders edition, which contains all brand new and exclusive features . Important : If you're sponsoring @squidfunk through a GitHub organization, please send a short email to sponsors@squidfunk.com with the name of your organization and the account that should be added as a collaborator. 2 You can cancel your sponsorship anytime. 3 Join our awesome sponsors If you sponsor publicly, you're automatically added here with a link to your profile and avatar to show your support for Material for MkDocs. Alternatively, if you wish to keep your sponsorship private, you'll be a silent +1. You can select visibility during checkout and change it afterwards. Exclusive features \u00b6 The following features are currently exclusively available to sponsors: Boosting pages in search Tags (with search integration) Stay on page when switching versions Version warning Custom admonition icons Code block annotations Anchor tracking Section index pages Sticky navigation tabs Mermaid.js integration Search suggestions Search highlighting Search sharing Remove generator notice New features are added to this list every few weeks, so be sure to come back from time to time to learn about what's new, or follow @squidfunk on Twitter to stay updated. Funding \u00b6 Goals \u00b6 Following is a list of funding goals. When a funding goal is hit, the features that are tied to it are merged back into Material for MkDocs and released to the public for general availability. $ 2,500 \u2013 Biquinho Vermelho \u00b6 Search suggestions Search highlighting Search sharing $ 3,000 \u2013 Caribbean Red \u00b6 Sticky navigation tabs Section index pages Remove generator notice $ 4,000 \u2013 Ghost Pepper \u00b6 Anchor tracking Code block annotations Version warning $ 5,000 \u2013 Aji Panca \u00b6 Mermaid.js integration Stay on page when switching versions Tags (with search integration) $ 6,000 \u2013 Trinidad Scorpion \u00b6 Boosting pages in search Improved search result summaries Stay on page when switching languages $ 7,000 \u2013 Royal Gold \u00b6 Table of contents auto-collapse Table of contents follows active anchor Native lightbox integration $ 8,000 \u2013 Scotch Bonnet \u00b6 Custom admonition icons Table of contents shows which sections have search results List of last searches Future \u00b6 Material for MkDocs Live Edit New layouts and styles Code block palette toggle Goals completed \u00b6 $ 2,000 \u2013 Black Pearl \u00b6 Latest release tag Color palette toggle Back-to-top button $ 1,500 \u2013 Bhut Jolokia \u00b6 Admonition inline blocks Site language selection Versioning $ 1,000 \u2013 Prairie Fire \u00b6 Navigation sections Navigation expansion Hiding the sidebars Table of contents in navigation Header hides on scroll $ 500 \u2013 Madame Jeanette \u00b6 Improved search result grouping Improved search result relevance and scoring Missing query terms in search results Frequently asked questions \u00b6 Compatibility \u00b6 We're running an open source project and want to make sure that users can build the documentation without having access to Insiders. Is this still possible? Yes. Insiders is compatible with Material for MkDocs. All new features are implemented behind feature flags; all configuration changes are backward-compatible. This means that your users will be able to build the documentation locally with Material for MkDocs and when they push their changes, it can be built with Insiders (e.g. as part of GitHub Actions). Thus, it's recommended to install Insiders only in CI, as you don't want to expose your GH_TOKEN to users. Terms \u00b6 We're using Material for MkDocs to build the developer documentation of a commercial project. Can we use Insiders under the same terms and conditions? Yes. Whether you're an individual or a company, you may use Material for MkDocs Insiders precisely under the same terms as Material for MkDocs, which are given by the MIT license . However, we kindly ask you to respect the following guidelines: Please don't distribute the source code of Insiders. You may freely use it for public, private or commercial projects, fork it, mirror it, do whatever you want with it, but please don't release the source code, as it would counteract the sponsorware strategy. If you cancel your subscription, you're removed as a collaborator and will miss out on future updates of Insiders. However, you may use the latest version that's available to you as long as you like . Just remember that GitHub deletes private forks . You may ask yourself why you should pay for something that is Open Source. Doesn't that contradict the ethos of Open Source software? Yes and no. Yes, some features are locked behind a monthly subscription, which means they are only accessible when paying a small amount of money. No, the features are only exclusive for a short time until specific funding goals are hit. Making an Open Source project sustainable is exceptionally hard: maintainers burn out, projects are abandoned. That's not great and very unpredictable. The sponsorware model ensures that if you decide to use Material for MkDocs, you can be sure that bugs are fixed quickly and new features are added regularly. \u21a9 It's currently not possible to grant access to each member of an organization, as GitHub only allows for adding users. Thus, after sponsoring, please send an email to sponsors@squidfunk.com , stating which account should become a collaborator of the Insiders repository. We're working on a solution which will make access to organizations much simpler. To ensure that access is not tied to a particular individual GitHub account, create a bot account (i.e. a GitHub account that is not tied to a specific individual), and use this account for the sponsoring. After being added to the list of collaborators, the bot account can create a private fork of the private Insiders GitHub repository, and grant access to all members of the organizations. \u21a9 If you cancel your sponsorship, GitHub schedules a cancellation request which will become effective at the end of the billing cycle, which ends at the 22 nd of a month for monthly sponsorships. This means that even though you cancel your sponsorship, you will keep your access to Insiders as long as your cancellation isn't effective. All charges are processed by GitHub through Stripe. As we don't receive any information regarding your payment, and GitHub doesn't offer refunds, sponsorships are non-refundable. \u21a9","title":"Insiders"},{"location":"insiders/#insiders","text":"Material for MkDocs follows the sponsorware release strategy, which means that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors as part of Insiders .

Dense Associative Memory for Pattern Recognition \u2014 joint work by Dmitry Krotov and John Hopfield. Presented at NIPS 2016, this paper is an effort to bring together these two distinct theories and be able to do pattern recognition more effectively. Let\u2019s use an analogy to explain what duality means With the advent of the nineteenth century, many physicists became enamoured by a strange fundamental question. Including them were \u2014 Albert Einstein, Thomas Young, Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger (yup, the man with the cat) and Werner Heisenberg \u2014 the geniuses who laid the foundation for Quantum Physics. The question was \u2014 \u201cHow does the light travel from one place to another?\u201d. A few experiments and some abstractions later, two complementary theories were proposed to explain how light behaves and how it transmits \u2014 The Particle Theory and The Wave Theory. However, the results observed suggested that neither of these theories managed to explain the complete behaviour of light \u2014 neither was fully right or was fully wrong. Light, to this day, exhibits this strange unexplained \u201cduality\u201d. For the sake of simplicity. we can roughly think of all the deep neural networks as distributed in two categories: Feed-Forward Networks (includes CNN, Auto-Encoders, GAN) and Cyclic Networks (includes RNN, Hopfield*, Markov Chain, Boltzmann Machine). Two goals of this paper: \u00b6 Study two models of pattern recognition \u2014 feature classification and prototype recognition. Establish a duality between Associative Memory Neural Networks and Feed Forward Neural Networks. Associative memory functions are represented by two major functions \u2014 an energy function and a dynamical update function (or state function that just like a gradient descent rule decreases the energy at every update). The idea of associative memory is that local minima of the energy function corresponds to some meaningful patterns of images and by going down the energy surface, one can recover the nearest local minimum which corresponds to some pattern from the training set. Generally associative memory network are represented by an energy function that looks something like this- and an update rule that looks something like this- where ( do not worry what these complex looking functions mean as of now \u2014 trust me they are not so complicated and aren\u2019t useful to build a general understanding of this paper ) These conventional associative nets with these functions can store approximately 0.14N memories. If one tries to store more patterns, several memories would converge together to create new patterns making the classification harder (there is even a term for that called Spurious Networks). However, we know that the size of the network and the number of memories stored hold a non-linear scaling relationship (proved in the paper). Thus, assuming this rule, we come up with a new class of associative models of higher order polynomial defined by the functions - and the update rule mentioned above. This new associative memory model was tested on XOR and it was found to be capable of solving the problem for higher order odd values of n (the interaction vertex of two or more nuerons). Then, they used another test case : MNIST (50000 training images, 10000 test images) and results proved that it works for n>=2 and interestingly the training time was faster than that in the case of ReLU on feed forward networks thus making it more efficient to train large training sets such as ImageNet. Additionally, this model has an exponentially increasing capacity that allows one to store N^(n-1) models (>0.14N) which can mean better and faster image classification due to higher number of stored patterns. how does the computation change as n varies? \u00b6 The authors selected 25 randomly selected memories and trained them using rectified polynomial energy function of orders n= 2,3,20, 30. So it looks like this - As we can see, as n increases the memories have transitioned from a set of features to a set of prototypes at approximately n=20. Depending on your particular case, it might be easier to classify an image based on features and other better as a prototype. For the sake of an example, the exact species of canine (Labrador vs. German Shepherd) be classified using prototype based classification and cats vs dogs can use a feature based classification (though it must be a bit harder than that given dogs do come in all sizes and forms). So far this has only been applied to simple models like MNIST, but in general this computational regime remains largely unexplored. Any extension outside of simple MNIST experiments would be very interesting to confirm the proposition. Now, it only makes sense to extend the this feature-prototype based classification to feed forward networks to see if feed forward networks too can benefit from such an application. So the authors made a few assumptions to deduce a relation between the two theories ( loosely like string theory in physics ) such that a computational model has two different descriptions : one in terms of associative memory and other in terms of a feedforward network - The feedforward network has only one hidden layer The associative memory model performs only a one step update The labels contain far less information that the data itself The classifications neurons of an associative model are all initialized in the state -\u03b5 Using the above assumptions, the authors were able to create a construction such that f(x) = F\u2019(x) Where f(x) is the activation function from the visible layer to the hidden layer in a feedforward network and F(x) is the energy function of associative memory model. The result suggests that the activation function of feedforward network is equal to the derivative of the energy function of the associative model i.e. for every small change in x, F(x) changes by f(x). Thus, for various n the activation and energy function are related such that - Where RePn represents rectified polynomial of order n. As we concluded previously, the speed of learning should increase as n increases given the higher number of stored patterns. Thus according to the table the ReLU function should be faster than tan hyperbolic function or logistic functions (used in 1980s and 90s) which is consistent with our knowledge of ReLU and thus we can also suggest that these rectified higher polynomial activation functions (ReP) might have even better computational properties than ReLU. Thus, at this point we can derive two things - ReP activation functions might have as good if not substantially better results than ReLU along with a few interesting attributes. These attributes can be inherited to FNN to probably utilize both prototype and feature classification methods into deep learning Some interesting future extensions of this work for readers to explore and experiment would be- \u00b6 Extension of this result for multilayer network architectures. Application of RePU activation functions for feedforward neural networks Application of the dense associative memory models (with RePU) to problems outside MNIST.

Within the past few years, we have seen a huge number of machine learning libraries and frameworks to enable us to build machine learning models \u2014 faster, scalable and accessible. Two of the most prominent of these frameworks are \u2014 TensorFlow and PyTorch . While it is incredibly tempting to do a side by side comparison for both but I think, to sum it up, one can say that PyTorch is easier to use, lighter and flexible (dynamic computational graph) whereas TensorFlow is a complete production level tool. While it has more abstractions and a steep learning curve but it is extremely powerful and tops everything else when it comes to scalability for your deep learning models. When working with deep learning models however, this low-level architecture mastery for TensorFlow and the high-level architecture mastery for deep learning can seem like a ridiculously tall order. It leads to an abstraction gap that demands for some bridging tools. These bridging tools need to fulfill few key requirements in order to be effective: Simplicity Flexibility Functionality Portability Scalability Performance Thus, over the past few years a few excellent bridging tools and libraries have been developed. These include TensorLayer, Keras, TFLearn etc. But do they compare? So what is TensorLayer? \u00b6 TensorLayer , is a part of Google\u2019s popular machine learning and numerical computational framework TensorFlow . It provides popular Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning modules that can be easily customized and assembled for tackling real-world machine learning problems. The idea behind this library was to facilitate a modular approach to Deep Learning as well as Reinforcement Learning to tackle complex as well as iterative tasks for when it comes to large neural networks and their interactions. How? \u00b6 1 . It provides high-level state-of-the-art deep learning modules 2 . It enables the users to build a model using native TensorFlow APIs Also, 3 . It enables the users to define their own computational operations 4 . It enables the users to define their own training logic 5 . The users can glue different modules together (e.g., connected with TF-Slim and Keras ). 6 . It provides zero-cost abstraction (or negligible overhead) 7 . It allows easy scaling of your models from laptops to clouds. In fact, it is because of these incredibly powerful features that TensorLayer was awarded the 2017 Best Open Source Software by the prestigious ACM Multimedia Society. Quick Recap: \u00b6 Speed: It is basically designed in order to speed-up experimentation and developments by providing a higher-level API to TensorFlow . Flexibility: TensorLayer APIs are transparent in nature hence leaving the user with massive hooks that support diverse low-level tuning. Customizable : TensorLayer is quite easily extensible as well as modifiable. Zero-cost Abstraction: TensorLayer has the ability to achieve the performance of TensorFlow at its fullest. Modular Reference Layers: The highlighting feature of TensorLayer lies in the IDE-like approach where the host of operations such as neural networks , their states, data and other parameters are assorted into easily accessible modules. When compared with TensorFlow , TensorLayer closely fares the same when classic ML models of neural networks are performed. Although it might look like a setback, it allows the layer module in TensorLayer to cater to customized models. But on the other hand, it uses indexing concepts for quicker row selection while handling datasets. Also, the cache is stored locally to handle workloads with larger data for optimal performance. In addition, it also helps the workflow module to implement Deep Learning models using \u2018asynchronous training \u2019.

In 2006, Shane Legg and Marcus Hutter decided to conduct a comprehensive literature review for the definition of intelligence in various disciplines. And thus, it paved the way for them to create a \u201ccomplete\u201d definition of intelligence finally presented in their 2007 paper Universal Intelligence: A Definition of Machine Intelligence . They defined it as - Intelligence measures an agent\u2019s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments Various Kinds of Intelligence \u00b6 While the above definition sound pretty general and obviously so. A goal can be anything\u200a\u2014\u200afrom moving from place A to place B\u200a\u2014\u200ato\u200a\u2014\u200arecognizing cat breeds from dog breeds\u200a\u2014\u200ato\u200a\u2014\u200aplanning a birthday party. While most earlier intelligence tests only tested for cognitive intelligence, for artificial intelligence- we have another equally important field of work to develop, often dealt in robotics, called Physical Intelligence. One can easily remark that physical intelligence can, in fact, be broken into a sequence of decisions combined with motor abilities for a machine. All right, let\u2019s take another example to mark the distinction- when we touch a hot saucepan we instantly pull our hand away, what kind of intelligence would you call it since it isn\u2019t a goal-oriented intelligence? Maybe consciousness?! But then how do you define consciousness? Unfortunately given our own limited understanding of human cognition, defining it as consciousness is likely to send us spiraling down a never-ending black hole of what it means for something to be conscious or to have free will. Big, important terms. Poorly understood. But beyond the scope of this article. So, for the sake of simplicity, let us call it physical intelligence i.e. our tendency to protect ourselves. Bodies by pulling our hand back or reproducing\u200a\u2014\u200a minds by saying I give up when the going gets hard\u200a\u2014\u200a emotions by distancing ourselves from the source of pain. But, neither kind, cognitive or physical intelligence has yet been fully developed in only but biological organisms, and in varying degrees. Coming to the next term in that definition, the environment . It\u2019s obvious that goals can only be measured in a particular environment. Environments, thus, act as the deterministic bounds for these goals. One of the most common domains where we explicitly seek, use and create environments is \u201cGames\u201d thus games become an excellent training ground for AI. Single Player Games \u00b6 Some of the key environments for AI training today are single agent games where A.I. agents accomplish a per-determined goal for a reward (an actual reward or simply higher accuracy). Open AI\u2019s Gym or MuJoCo is an excellent representation of many such environments where you can train your algorithm to perform for high accuracy on these games. There are some other open source implementations of these environments, for example, RL-Baselines-Zoo or RoboSchool or PyBullet Gym . Though, using A.I. in Games isn\u2019t a new phenomenon caused by the A.I. outbreak ( thanks Alex Net! ). A.I. has been long explored in the game domain. Among the key uses and implementations for A.I. in games earlier is developing new terrains, environments (esp. in rogue games) or defining the behaviors of NPCs (Non-Player Characters). Today, people in the game industry have now taken it a notch further by using AI to develop new game engines like Angelina . Key Algorithms for AI in Single Player Games \u00b6 While it would be beyond the scope of this article to define all the algorithms in detail, some excellent resources on this topic are Ian Millington\u2019s Book on Artificial Intelligence for Games and Julian Togelius\u2019 book on Artificial Intelligence and Games . On the big picture level, these algorithms can be classified into three broad categories- Movement Algorithms: This includes some of the most commonly known path-finding algorithms including Dijkstra or A* or Near-Optimal Hierarchical Path-finding (HPA) etc. Decision Making Algorithms: These include, but aren\u2019t limited to, decision trees, finite state machines (FSM), behavior trees, fuzzy state machines and Markov Systems. The third category is the advanced State of the Art A.I. algorithms that we aren\u2019t often seen in typical gaming industry implementations, though there are some exceptions we will discuss later. Some of these key unexploited algorithms include- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Evolutionary Algorithms (Random-Key Genetic Algorithms, Differential Evolution Algorithms etc) Deep Reinforcement Learning\u200a\u2014\u200aPolicy Gradient (PPO/TRPO), Q-Learning(DQN/HER) or Mixed Policy Optimization (DDPG/SAC) However, mainstream tech companies and academic labs for AI and Robotics, have been developing, exploiting and extending various AI algorithms and implementing them on simpler custom-built environments. However, one of the key limitations of using single-player games to model and develop A.I. in single-agent environments is the inability of these trained agents to achieve goals in different multi-agent environments, thus refuting Shane and Hutter\u2019s definition of intelligence. Intelligence measures an agent\u2019s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments. Multiplayer Games \u00b6 Some of the most prominent and recent success of our A.I. advancement can be captured by their performance on multiplayer games including Dota2 and StarCraft . This kind of environments often extend the capabilities of a single-player-environment-agent (SEA) to a multiplayer-environment-agent (MEA) by adding something extra to the mix. This extra is the tactical and strategic A.I. that includes way-point tactics, coordinated action and learning. Multi-player games come in many flavors\u200a\u2014\u200asmall (Warframe), huge (Super Mario) or Open World Games (Sims 4, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim) and thus present a huge play-field for the research and development for A.I. algorithms. The World is a Simulation \u00b6 While potentially a contrarian view, the key fascination for A.I. researchers in games stems from the ability to closely simulate the real world to understand and imitate human behaviors and actions. But isn\u2019t the goal to create machine learning algorithms that could compete and (or) cooperate with human beings? Yes, precisely. While playing a game, you are inside a carefully simulated world where your actions and reactions have been pre-planned by the game designer and are hard-coded in advance. Thus, one could argue that most games are boxes of complete (and also constantly evolving for open-world games) information. Thus, it\u2019s fair to say that if you can learn the rules you could win the game. However, the real world ain\u2019t much different. For years, the so-called capitalist companies have been studying human behaviors to influence human decisions. Companies like Apple and Zara use several variations of warehouses to study the effect of the music playing in their stores to the lighting and positioning of items in the store. Researchers from various backgrounds (business, psychology, economics, politics, finance, journalism\u200a\u2014\u200ayou name it) have for years studied how predictable humans are\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding Jonah Berger, Dan & Chip Heath, Fiery Cushman, Dan Ariely, Charles Duhigg, Daniel Kahneman, Richard H. Thaler, Daniel M. Oppenheimer. In fact, some of the most fascinating work in the field of complex human patterns can be contributed to the man who shocked the world, Stanley Milgram, who devised a simple Obedience experiment to answer the following question about Nazi Germany and Holocaust: Could it be that Eichmann and his million accomplices in the Holocaust were just following orders? Could we call them all merely accomplices?\u201d To someone who has never thought of his and other humans\u2019 behaviours as predictable, manipulable patterns, questions like these might seem like philosophical questions. However, based on Milgram\u2019s experiment, he reached a conclusive answer in his article Perils of Obedience Ordinary people are likely to follow orders given by an authority figure, even to the extent of killing an innocent human being. Obedience to authority is ingrained in us all from the way we are brought up. People tend to obey orders from other people if they recognize their authority as morally right and/or legally based. This led him to the development of Milgram\u2019s Agency Theory. Milgram\u2019s Agency Theory suggests humans have two mental states: Autonomous: In the Autonomous State we perceive ourselves to be responsible for our own behaviour so we feel guilty for what we do Agentic: In the Agentic State we perceive ourselves to be the agent of someone else\u2019s will; the authority figure commanding us is responsible for what we do so we feel no guilt. As such, humans are predictable beings who live in a carefully planned predictable open-world. According to Seanoe et. al. , the world we live in can also be interpreted as a biological (and, technological) evolution strongly tied to the generative potential tied through combinatorics that allows the system to grow and expand their available state spaces. Thus, many complex systems that presumably display Open-Ended Evolution, from language to proteins, share a common statistical property: the presence of Zipf\u2019s Law . Though, according to another study conducted by Thurner et. al. on human behavioural sequences in an online world, it suggested that on a collective societal level the time-series of particular actions per day can be understood by a simple mean-reverting log-normal model which explains the rarity of absolute autonomy. To conclude, it won\u2019t be wrong to say that we are merely agents with the two agencies (autonomous and agentic) in a multi-agent world. There are two essential ingredients when simulating human-like multi-agent societies- EvolutionThe environment or agent should be open-ended and constantly evolving. CreativityThe idea of seeing creativity as a search in a space of potential search-space is not new; it has been discussed at length by, for example, the British philosopher Margaret Boden. In fact, J. Schmidhuber has also worked tirelessly to capture the idea of curiosity and creativity to devise a Formal Theory of Creativity But training AI on Games isn\u2019t a good idea in the long run \u00b6 Let us substitute the word \u201cgame\u201d for the environment especially since we have established that the two mean the same in an agents\u2019 world. Now, the games or training environments for AI can be broadly classified into two categories which can be further divided into two sub-categories- Static Environments Dynamic Environments Dynamic Determinate Environments Dynamic Indeterminate Environments While training and developing AI algorithms to perform well on static environments is a near-finish goal however developing A.I. that can achieve goals in dynamic environments is an area of research where we quickly hit various roadblocks, esp in dynamic indeterminate environments. In my opinion, there are three key contributors to the same- First would be our inadequate understanding of complexity theory and chaos theory. One of the most interesting efforts that is being pursued in this direction is Fractal AI . Second is the lack of models. Most of our current AI models are data-hungry beasts that need huge computational resources. Some of the most interesting works in this direction pursued by the Game AI community are Framing for Computational Creativity and by the causal inference community The Book of Why The third is the problem of learning that includes transfer learning and lifelong learning. Some of the interesting works in this direction are AutoML Research , Meta-Learning and Differential Evolution (check Differential Plasticity ) Open-Endedness \u00b6 One of the classical properties of Dynamic Indeterminate Spaces is their open-endedness . Open-ended problems are hard to define and model thus are often abandoned due to the lack of definite metrics. Another way of looking at this problem is through the lens of algorithmic complexity namely Kolmogorov Complexity , Attribute Substitution , Occam\u2019s Razor and Adaptive Levin Search . However, a few researchers who dabbled into this space have created quite a perspective shift. One such work is the paper Exploiting Open-Endedness to Solve Problems Through the Search for Novelty . Later, another excellent work in novelty-search which a few years later led to the development of quality-diversity algorithms . According to one of the first papers in Quality diversity (QDA) algorithms by Kenneth Stanley et. al., QDAs is a kind of learning algorithm (for example, novelty search with local competition and MAP-Elites ) that try to balance the great dilemma in machine learning: exploration vs. exploitation . They aim to optimize for both quality and diversity simultaneously while aiming to fill a space of possibilities with the best possible example of each type of achievable behaviour. The result is this new class of algorithms that return an archive of diverse, high-quality behaviours in a single run. Though, because of the digital nature of inheritance, there are inherent limits on the kinds of questions that can be answered using such an approach. In particular, according to an excellent paper by Troy Day , even in extremely simple evolutionary systems, a complete theory accounting for the potential open-endedness of evolution is unattainable unless evolution is progressive. However, in 1936, Turing adapted Godel\u2019s Theory of Open-Endedness (also called Incompleteness) to computability to show that a general algorithm to solve the halting problem for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist. One of the rebuttals of Godel\u2019s open-endedness problem has been presented in Monads and Sets: On G\u00f6del, Leibniz, and the Reflection Principle . In complexity theory, it can also be interpreted as the Reflection Principle applied to the Wiener Process . So, if we were to agree with Godel and his theory of open-endedness, then how do we develop progressive environments thus leading to progressive search spaces and thus hopefully progressive quality-diversity search algorithms? Introducing PCG \u00b6 Procedural content generation (PCG) is the programmatic generation of game content using a random or pseudo-random process that results in an unpredictable range of possible gameplay spaces. But why games again? Didn\u2019t we just establish that games are inadequate training environments? Games make it easy to comparatively test and measure for novelty, delight and desirability in the newly created content. Some of the interesting applications of procedural content generation for training A.I. agents have been seen in the games like Obstacle Tower , Capture the Flag etc. Though it would be interesting to see A.I. agents trained on games like The Shadow of Mordor, a game where NPCs remember their encounters with you and refer back to them in future fights to more accurately represent the real world. Thus, PCG presents huge opportunities for the field of A.I. in general. However, one of the big problems would be while games present excellent training environments for training our A.I. agents in decision making for competition and cooperation. But one of the biggest challenges for these advanced A.I. algorithms would be coordination with humans due to the differences in evolution. Despite our common biological roots and parallel evolutionary process, it has taken animals and humans only 200,000 years to adapt and evolve alongside each other. Through these thousands of years of shared evolution, many animal species esp cats and dogs have become inseparable from human societies, not only terrestrially but also emotionally\u200a\u2014\u200aa magnificent feat especially given the lack of a common language of expression and entirely different cognitive and physical abilities. The Way Ahead: Mixed-Initiative Games \u00b6 This suggests that we could build A.I. systems where A.I. algorithms can collaborate with humans such that the AI can learn, provide suggestions and guess the intent of the human user to help him achieve common goals. Some interesting works in this direction are Mixed Initiative Game Design Platform Tangara , Quake III Arena , Sentinent Sketchbook which is used by AI to second guess the designer\u2019s intention, Collaborative Language Grounding with Robots , Hierarchical Imitation and Intrinsic Social Motivation via Causal Influence in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning * Acknowledgements: I would like to thank Ian Danforth for proofreading the article and providing useful feedback.","title":"Developing A.I. using Games"},{"location":"posts/2019-09-09-game-ai/#various-kinds-of-intelligence","text":"While the above definition sound pretty general and obviously so.

Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - navigation.expand With expansion Without expansion Section index pages \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag \u00b7 Experimental \u00b7 Insiders only When section index pages are enabled, documents can be directly attached to sections, which is particularly useful for providing overview pages.

Use them at your own risk. Navigation integration \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Feature flag When integration is enabled, the table of contents is rendered as part of the navigation for viewports above 1220px , but remains as-is on mobile. Add the following lines to mkdocs.yml : theme : features : - toc.integrate Integrate table of contents Separate table of contents The content section will now always stretch to the right side, resulting in more space for your content. This feature flag can be combined with all other feature flags, e.g. tabs and sections . Usage \u00b6 Hiding the sidebars \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Metadata Sometimes it's desirable to hide the navigation and/or table of contents sidebar, especially when there's a single navigation item. This can be done for any page using the Metadata extension: --- hide : - navigation # Hide navigation - toc # Hide table of contents --- ... Hide navigation Hide table of contents Hide both Customization \u00b6 Keyboard shortcuts \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy Material for MkDocs includes several keyboard shortcuts that make it possible to navigate your project documentation via keyboard. There're two modes: search This mode is active when the search is focused . It provides several key bindings to make search accessible and navigable via keyboard: Down , Up : select next / previous result Esc , Tab : close search dialog Enter : follow selected result global This mode is active when search is not focussed and when there's no other focussed element that is susceptible to keyboard input. The following keys are bound: F , S , / : open search dialog P , , : go to previous page N , . : go to next page Let's say you want to bind some action to the X key. By using additional JavaScript , you can subscribe to the keyboard$ observable and attach your custom event listener: keyboard$ . subscribe ( function ( key ) { if ( key . mode === \"global\" && key . type === \"x\" ) { /* Add custom keyboard handler here */ key . claim () } }) The call to key . claim () will essentially execute preventDefault () on the underlying event, so the keypress will not propagate further and touch other event listeners. Content area width \u00b6 Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy The width of the content area is set so the length of each line doesn't exceed 80-100 characters, depending on the width of the characters. While this is a reasonable default, as longer lines tend to be harder to read, it may be desirable to increase the overall width of the content area, or even make it stretch to the entire available space. This can easily be achieved with an additional stylesheet and a few lines of CSS: Increase width . md-grid { max-width : 1440 px ; } Stretch to fit . md-grid { max-width : initial ; } Prior to version 6.2, navigation tabs had a slightly different behavior. All top-level pages (i.e. all top-level entries that directly refer to an *.md file) defined inside the nav entry of mkdocs.yml were grouped under the first tab which received the title of the first page. This made it impossible to include a top-level page (or external link) as a tab item, as was reported in #1884 and #2072 . From version 6.2 on, navigation tabs include all top-level pages and sections. \u21a9 If you don't want to use the native integration, the mkdocs-section-index plugin might be an alternative. However, note that this plugin may not be compatible with all navigation-related features offered by Material for MkDocs. \u21a9","title":"Setting up navigation"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-navigation/#setting-up-navigation","text":"A clear and concise navigation structure is an important aspect of good project documentation.

The following keys are bound: F , S , / : open search dialog P , , : go to previous page N , . : go to next page Let's say you want to bind some action to the X key. By using additional JavaScript , you can subscribe to the keyboard$ observable and attach your custom event listener: keyboard$ . subscribe ( function ( key ) { if ( key . mode === \"global\" && key . type === \"x\" ) { /* Add custom keyboard handler here */ key . claim () } }) The call to key . claim () will essentially execute preventDefault () on the underlying event, so the keypress will not propagate further and touch other event listeners.","title":"Keyboard shortcuts"},{"location":"setup/setting-up-navigation/#content-area-width","text":"Source \u00b7 Difficulty: easy The width of the content area is set so the length of each line doesn't exceed 80-100 characters, depending on the width of the characters. While this is a reasonable default, as longer lines tend to be harder to read, it may be desirable to increase the overall width of the content area, or even make it stretch to the entire available space. This can easily be achieved with an additional stylesheet and a few lines of CSS: Increase width . md-grid { max-width : 1440 px ; } Stretch to fit . md-grid { max-width : initial ; } Prior to version 6.2, navigation tabs had a slightly different behavior. All top-level pages (i.e. all top-level entries that directly refer to an *.md file) defined inside the nav entry of mkdocs.yml were grouped under the first tab which received the title of the first page. This made it impossible to include a top-level page (or external link) as a tab item, as was reported in #1884 and #2072 .
