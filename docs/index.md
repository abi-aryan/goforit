My name is Abi Aryan. I am a Machine Learning (ML) Engineer and a Data Science Fellow at Insight in Toronto. I was previously a Visiting Research Scholar at UCLA under [Dr. Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html) where I worked in AutoML, MultiAgent Systems and Emotion Recognition. Prior to that, I worked as product and engineering head for five years with startups across U.S., U.K., and India. 

I attended [London School of Economics (LSE)](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Mathematics) for a Masters in Applicable Mathematics and did my Bachelors in Mathematics with minors in Statistics and Computer Science from [Maharshi Dayanand University (MDU)](https://mdu.ac.in/).

I am, foremost, driven by the goal to create personalized humane-agents that can influence and alter human decision making, but subsconsciously, also the nagging desire to leave the world a slightly better place than I found it. A tad bit geeky and a gadget lover at heart, I am equally fascinated by large-scale engineering application design as well as low level computer hardware engineering including microprocessors, crafting compilers, integrated chip design etc.

I am also passionate about communities and helping self-taught engineers get into technical careers. I am the Director for [Women Who Code Los Angeles](https://www.womenwhocode.com/la) and founded [MLNerdie](https://www.mlnerdie.com/) to bridge the gap between academia and industry in machine learning with [chapters and volunteers spread across three continents](https://www.mlnerdie.com/chapter/).
